# RAG Agent Tasks Generated

## Prompt
$ARGUMENTS

## Response
Successfully generated comprehensive task list for the RAG agent implementation. The tasks.md file contains 25 specific, actionable tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. Setup Phase: Project initialization and environment setup
2. Foundational Components: Core infrastructure components
3. User Story 1: Core RAG functionality (P1 priority)
4. User Story 2: Configuration and retrieval integration (P2 priority)
5. User Story 3: Local testing capabilities (P3 priority)
6. Polish & Cross-Cutting: Error handling, validation, and documentation

Tasks include specific file paths and follow the required format with checkboxes, task IDs, user story labels, and parallel execution markers where appropriate. The implementation strategy follows an MVP approach with User Story 1 providing immediate value.

## Outcome
Generated complete task breakdown ready for implementation with clear organization by user story priority and dependencies.

## Evaluation
The task list is comprehensive, follows the required format, and enables independent implementation and testing of each user story. All tasks are specific enough for execution without additional context.
