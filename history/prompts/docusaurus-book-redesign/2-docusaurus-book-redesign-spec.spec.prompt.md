# Docusaurus Book Redesign Specification

## Summary

Created comprehensive specification for the Docusaurus Book Cleanup & Professional UI Redesign project. This feature will transform the current Docusaurus-based book website from a default template with tutorial content into a clean, professional, and visually attractive documentation site focused solely on the technical book content.

## Key Components

- Complete feature specification with user stories, requirements, and success criteria
- Professional neural network/AI-themed UI redesign
- Content cleanup to remove default Docusaurus tutorial and blog content
- Custom homepage with 3-6 visually distinct cards highlighting key book sections
- Responsive and accessible design maintaining across all devices

## Success Criteria

- No default Docusaurus tutorial pages accessible
- Professional, modern AI-themed design
- Homepage with clear book title, subtitle, and content highlight cards
- Neural network-inspired visual identity
- Maintained accessibility and responsive design

## Next Steps

Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan) to design the implementation approach for the cleanup and redesign.
