# Docusaurus Redesign Planning

## Summary

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Docusaurus Book Cleanup & Professional Neural-Themed UI project. This plan outlines the approach to transform the current Docusaurus site into a clean, professional book-focused design with neural network theme.

## Key Components

- Complete implementation plan with 10 phases
- Research document addressing technical unknowns
- Data model for existing content structure
- Quickstart guide for development workflow
- Placeholder contracts directory

## Planning Approach

The plan follows the user's requested phases:
1. Project audit and baseline setup
2. Removal of unrelated Docusaurus content
3. Conversion to book-only architecture
4. Custom neural-themed homepage design
5. Card-based layout implementation
6. UI styling and animations
7. Navigation and UX refinement
8. Responsiveness and cross-device testing
9. Configuration cleanup
10. Final validation and quality checks

## Technical Decisions

- Neural network visual theme with gradient colors
- CSS-based animations for performance
- Custom React components for homepage
- Card-based layout for content highlights
- Dark theme with blue/purple gradients

## Next Steps

Ready for task breakdown phase (/sp.tasks) to create executable tasks for the implementation.
