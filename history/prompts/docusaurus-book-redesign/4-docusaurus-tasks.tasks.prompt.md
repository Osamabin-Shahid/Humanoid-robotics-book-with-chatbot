# Docusaurus Redesign Tasks

## Summary

Created comprehensive task breakdown for the Docusaurus Book Cleanup & Professional Neural UI project. The tasks are organized into 7 phases following the user story approach for independent implementation and testing.

## Task Organization

- **Phase 1**: Setup tasks (4 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational tasks (20 tasks)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Clean Book-Focused Experience (5 tasks)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Professional AI-Themed Design (8 tasks)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Engaging Homepage with Content Highlights (9 tasks)
- **Phase 6**: User Story 4 - Responsive and Accessible Design (9 tasks)
- **Phase 7**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (17 tasks)

## Total Tasks: 72

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

Multiple tasks can be executed in parallel, particularly:
- Theme implementation tasks (T026-T028)
- Homepage component tasks (T034-T036)
- Configuration cleanup tasks
- Cross-cutting concerns in Phase 7

## MVP Scope

The MVP includes User Story 1 (clean book-focused experience) which provides immediate value by removing all default Docusaurus content and creating a distraction-free reading environment.

## Next Steps

Ready for implementation phase (/sp.implement) to execute the tasks according to the defined phases and dependencies.
