# Glossary

## A

**Action**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks that provides feedback during execution and returns a final result.

**AI Agent**: An intelligent system that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve goals.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: A middleware protocol and API standard for real-time, scalable, and reliable data exchange between applications.

**Digital AI Pipeline**: An artificial intelligence system that operates in virtual environments with predictable rules and no physical consequences.

## E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world through robotic bodies.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system.

**Motor Control**: The process of controlling the movement of robot actuators.

## N

**Node**: A process that performs computation in ROS 2. Nodes are designed to be modular and can run on the same or different devices.

## P

**Physical AI System**: An artificial intelligence system that operates in the real world where actions have immediate, tangible effects.

**Publisher**: A ROS 2 node that sends messages to topics.

## Q

**QoS (Quality of Service)**: Settings in ROS 2 that control communication behavior, including reliability, durability, history, and deadline.

## R

**Real-time System**: A system that must respond to inputs within strict time constraints.

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing services designed specifically for robotic applications.

**ROS 2**: The second generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to address limitations in ROS 1, particularly in security, real-time performance, and multi-robot systems.

## S

**Service**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for synchronous request/response interactions.

**Subscriber**: A ROS 2 node that receives messages from topics.

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to achieve better accuracy and reliability than could be achieved by using a single sensor.

## T

**Topic**: A communication mechanism in ROS 2 that enables one-way communication where data flows from publishers to subscribers.

## W

**Wireless Communication**: Communication between robot components or between robots without physical connections.
