# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This module introduces you to ROS 2 as the nervous system of humanoid robots, establishing the foundational mental models required to connect AI agents with physical robot control systems.

## About This Module

This module is structured in three progressive chapters, each building upon the previous one to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 and its role in robotics:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Foundations** - Understand what ROS 2 is and why it exists
2. **Chapter 2: ROS 2 as Middleware** - Learn how ROS 2 connects AI agents to physical systems
3. **Chapter 3: Digital vs Physical AI** - Compare digital AI pipelines with physical robot control

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- Software developers with basic Python knowledge
- AI learners transitioning from digital AI to physical/embodied AI
- Robotics beginners preparing for humanoid simulation and control

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and benefits of ROS 2 in robotic systems
- Understand how ROS 2 functions as middleware connecting AI agents to physical robot control systems
- Distinguish between digital AI and physical robot control systems
- Apply appropriate ROS 2 patterns instead of pure digital AI approaches

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming concepts
- High-level understanding of AI agents
- No prior ROS experience required

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to establish the foundational concepts, then progress through each chapter in sequence for the best learning experience. Each chapter includes knowledge checks and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

Let's begin exploring how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system of humanoid robots!
