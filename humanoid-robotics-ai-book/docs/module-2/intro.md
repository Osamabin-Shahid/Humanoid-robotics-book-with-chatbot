# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This module introduces you to digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-based simulation with Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization with Unity, enabling you to understand, simulate, and validate humanoid robot behavior before real-world deployment.

## About This Module

This module is structured in three progressive chapters, each building upon the previous one to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of simulation for humanoid robots:

1. **Chapter 1: Physics-Based Simulation with Gazebo** - Understand physics simulation fundamentals
2. **Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Environments with Unity** - Learn about visualization and interaction
3. **Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation for Perception** - Cover sensor simulation for AI training

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI engineers and robotics students with basic ROS 2 knowledge
- Learners transitioning from software-only AI to embodied AI systems

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of digital twins in robotics and their importance for Physical AI
- Understand when to use Gazebo vs Unity for different simulation requirements
- Conceptually design a simulation pipeline for a humanoid robot
- Demonstrate understanding of physics-based simulation concepts for humanoid robots
- Articulate the importance of sensor simulation for AI perception in Physical AI systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic ROS 2 knowledge (Module 1 concepts)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to establish the foundational concepts of digital twins and physics-based simulation with Gazebo, then progress through each chapter in sequence for the best learning experience. Each chapter includes knowledge checks and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

Let's explore how digital twins enable safe and efficient development of humanoid robots!
